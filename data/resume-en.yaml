intro: "I am an enthusiastic software developer with more than five years experience in backend,
  frontend and app development. In the last 10 years, in addition to technical skills, I have gained
  extensive knowledge in all phases of software development. From requirement engineering, creating
  prototypes, conceptual design to testing, rollout and writing documentation. I have successfully
  completed projects on my own but also enjoy working in larger teams."
